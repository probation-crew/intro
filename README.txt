A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/ambonium/pen/kdnHf.

 Clean portrait presentation of staff/team/testimonial or similar person groups with fly-out details on click.  
I got the idea for this while looking at this [Simple Button Pen](http://codepen.io/kunalbhat/pen/bgnyL "Simple Button CodePen by Kunal Bhat") by [Kunal Bhat](http://codepen.io/kunalbhat/ "CodePen Profile Page of Kunal Bhat").  
The Portraits got a hidden list element with details, that are shown on mouse click. The details could be anything really. The portraits will gracefully break lines even if you zoom browser text size. The size change of the list in smaller screen resolutions will provoke you to reload the jquery script or there'll be a wrong positioning.
